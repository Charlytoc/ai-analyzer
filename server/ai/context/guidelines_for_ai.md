# How an AI Should Draft a “Citizen-Friendly” Judgment

First, let’s understand what a citizen-friendly judgment is.

A citizen-friendly judgment is essentially a point-by-point summary of a formal court decision. It takes a pile of legal documents and condenses them into a short, direct document that anyone can understand—regardless of legal training.

## Technical Elements of a Formal Judgment

A judicial decision from the Judiciary of the State of Mexico consists of several formal and substantive parts that ensure its legal validity and clarity. While details may vary by case type (criminal, civil, family, etc.), in general a judgment includes:

1. **Header**
   - Name of the court (e.g., “Second Civil Court of the Judicial District of Toluca”)
   - Case number
   - Names of the parties (plaintiff and defendant, or victim and accused)
   - Type of proceeding

2. **Resultandos**  
   - A narrative of the case background: what each party alleged or requested, the evidence offered, and key procedural acts  
   - Presented in chronological, detailed form

3. **Considerandos**  
   - The core analysis where the judge explains the legal reasoning  
   - Evaluation of the evidence and argument for why one side prevails  
   - Citations of laws, legal principles, and precedents as needed

4. **Puntos Resolutivos**  
   - The concrete orders of the judge  
   - Clearly states what is granted or denied, what must be done or not done  
   - Has binding effect on the parties

A **citizen-friendly judgment** is a version written in clear, accessible language for anyone without legal training—especially the parties involved. Its goal is to bring justice closer to citizens by promoting transparency, accountability, and effective access to justice. Such a judgment must include:

1. **First Section (Header-style)**  
   In a very simple, brief paragraph indicate:  
   - The court that issued the decision  
   - The place and date of issuance  
   - The case number  
   - The type of proceeding (controversy, trial, process, litigation)  
   - Whether it is an interlocutory or final judgment (a final judgment decides the merits of the case; an interlocutory one decides an incident or procedural matter)

2. **Second Section (Resultandos-style)**  
   In brief paragraphs and short sentences, direct tone:  
   - Parties involved (the plaintiff is the holder of the right, even if represented; in civil/family/mercantile/labor cases the sides are plaintiff and defendant; in criminal cases they are victim and accused)  
   - The action sought  
   - The reason for the dispute and the remedies claimed  
   - Key facts of the case (including those alleged by the plaintiff and those countered by the defendant)

3. **Third Section (Considerandos-style)**  
   In brief paragraphs, short sentences, direct tone, avoid legal jargon (if needed, define terms in parentheses):  
   - The legal question(s) to resolve  
   - The evidence presented and relied upon by the court  
   - The court’s decision (**ratio decidendi**), i.e. the fundamental legal principle that justifies the ruling—explained in citizen-friendly language  
   - Clarify that in a trial “no one wins or loses”; rather, rights are assigned to whoever proved their case under the evidence

4. **Fourth Section (Puntos Resolutivos-style)**  
   In brief paragraphs, short sentences, direct tone, avoid legal jargon (if needed, define terms):  
   - The court’s specific orders  
   - The consequences or “next steps” and deadlines to comply

Always use Markdown formatting so the citizen-friendly judgment’s structure is easy to follow.
